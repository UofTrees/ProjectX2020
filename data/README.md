# Data
We have collected microclimatic data from India and Costa Rica, two regions of the world known for having vast banana plantations and synthesized the corresponding infection risk variable via a probabilistic survival process inspired by [2].

| Region             | Latitude | Longitude |
|--------------------|----------|-----------|
| Costa Rica         | 10.39    | -83.812   |
| Maharashtra, India | 18.8143  | 73.125    |

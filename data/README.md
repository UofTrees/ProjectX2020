# Data
We have collected microclimatic data from 7 regions of the world known for having vast banana plantations and synthesized the corresponding infection risk variable via a probabilistic survival process inspired by [2].

Due to time constraints, we ran our experiments based on data from Costa Rica `(83.812 W, 10.39 N)`, and India `(73.125 E, 18.8143 N)`. Nevertheless, our data is publicly available in this directory.

| Region             | Latitude | Longitude |
|--------------------|----------|-----------|
| Costa Rica         | 10.39    | -83.812   |
| Tamali Nadu, India | 10.39    | 78.1875   |
| Maharashtra, India | 19.3759  | 73.125    |
| Maharashtra, India | 18.8143  | 73.125    |
| Guangxi, China     | 21.6224  | 109.688   |
| Guangdong, China   | 23.3073  | 113.625   |
| Davao, Philippine  | 7.5819   | 126       |
